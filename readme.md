This is a basic URL shortener that I have built as a sample project purely to see if I could do it or not.

The technologies used in this are:
- Python3
- Flask
- Flask SQLAlchemy
- Flask Security
- Bootstrap 3
- jQuery 3

This is a private project and is not meant for third party production use, but feel free to fork the project and poke around.  I'm always open to ideas on improvement
